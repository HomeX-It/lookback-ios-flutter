# Lookback iOS Flutter
Flutter plugin for the lookback iOS SDK
## Description
[Lookback](https://lookback.io/) is a product tool that helps you engage your users while they use your product. To use Lookback on iOS you must use their SDK and add a small about of Objective-C/Swift code.
This library allows you to add Lookback as a pub dependency in your Flutter app by adding 1 line in your pubspec.yaml and allows you to avoid writing any native code.
## Why iOS only?
There is no Android part of this plugin because Lookback does not require an SDK on Android. Read more about that [here](https://help.lookback.io/installing-the-ios-sdk/overview-of-the-ios-sdk).
